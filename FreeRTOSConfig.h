The DMA uses a chain of descriptors to reference Ethernet buffers, and provide
information on the state of each buffer (full/empty/error/etc.).
configNUM_RX_ETHERNET_DMA_DESCRIPTORS defines the total number of receive
descriptors (descriptors that point to buffers into which the DMA will write
packets received from the network).  An Ethernet buffer is assigned to each
descriptor.  Having too few descriptors will impact reliability because the DMA
will have to drop packets that are received when there are no receive
descriptors free.  It is however only necessary to have a couple of free
descriptors at a time, and having more wastes the RAM used by the Ethernet
buffers that are surplus to requirements. */

The DMA uses a chain of descriptors to reference Ethernet buffers that are

defines the total number of transmit descriptors.  An Ethernet buffer is
not assigned to a transmit descriptor until data is actually sent, but will
remain assigned to the descriptor until the descriptor is re-used.  It is not
necessary to have many transmit descriptors as the IP stack task will be held
in the Blocked state (so other tasks can run) until a descriptor becomes
available if it attempts to transmit when all the descriptors are in use.  See
the iptraceWAITING_FOR_TX_DMA_DESCRIPTOR() IP trace macro. */
